            The price of renewable energy drops as infrastructure increases.
            Solar energy alone has dropped to around $0.50 per watt, and
            renewable energy sources are some of the most affordable. Newly
            installed renewable power capacity is increasingly less expensive
            than the cheapest fossil-fuel-based power generation options.
            Replacing coal with wind and solar could cut costs by around $23
            billion per year.Â

            As a homeowner, if you switch to green energy, the government will
            provide you with tax credits for things such as rooftop solar, wind
            energy, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage. You can claim the
            annual credit every year that you install eligible property until
            the credit begins to phase out in 2033. The credit percentage rate
            phases down to 26 percent for property placed in service in 2033 and
            22 percent for property placed in service in 2034. This is done
            through the Residential Clean Energy Credit which equals up to 30%
            of the costs of new, qualified clean energy property for your home.
            The credit is nonrefundable, so the credit amount you receive can't
            exceed the amount you owe in tax. The credit has no annual or
            lifetime dollar limit except for credit limits for fuel cell
            property. You can claim the annual credit every year that you
            install eligible property until the credit begins to phase out in
            2033 .

            Residential renewable energy prices have been steadily declining
            over the past few years. With solar and wind power becoming
            increasingly affordable, now is the perfect time for homeowners to
            make the switch. Not only will you save money in the long run, but
            you'll also be doing your part to protect the environment. Renewable
            energy sources like solar and wind are clean, sustainable, and
            virtually inexhaustible. By embracing these technologies, you'll
            reduce your carbon footprint and contribute to a greener, healthier
            planet for future generations. Don't miss out on this opportunity to
            join the renewable energy revolution and secure a brighter future
            for your home and our world.
